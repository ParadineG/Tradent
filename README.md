# Tradent

Tradent is an application built primarily for university students to sell, trade, and/or give away items they no longer need. This includes, but is not limited to household items, books, and clothes. Users can either choose to barter or sell/purchase. The idea of this application came from the need for international students to get rid of the items they don’t need anymore, and for newcomers to gain them in a reasonable deal. Tradent opens the market for vast possibilities of trade such as bartering knowledge by providing teaching and learning services, or even of repairing services. Items will be categorized by their type, name, price, or user and there will be a separate tab for services. Users can also create a wishlist and when their desired item is listed, they will receive a notification message from the app and a link to the item’s page. There will be a five star rating system. At one star, the user has an unfavorable status and is not likely to receive much offers or requests. At five stars, that will grant them respect and priority of their goods to appear frequently on the featured page. This system will help establish an honest community for trading.
